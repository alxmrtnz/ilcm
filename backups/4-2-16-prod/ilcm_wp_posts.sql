Please see chart below for specifics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Type of Immigration Case</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">ILCM can only assist in immigration-related cases. If you are an immigrant who needs help with another area of law, such as housing, family law, public benefits, or employmentÃ¢ÂÂour office will not be able to assist you. Also, we cannot assist with nonimmigrant visas such as student or business visas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Available Staff Resources</h3>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Like every service provider, ILCM does not have unlimited staff resources. We may not be able to assist with every case, even though you may otherwise qualify for our services. We strive to help with as many cases as possible while still providing high-quality representation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">If you meet the first three criteria you will need to call during our phone intake from Monday to Wednesday from 12:00 to 1:30 pm and Thursday from 6 to 7:30 pm. We are unable to accept walk-in appointments. Calling during our weekly phone intake is the only way that new clients will be able to receive legal advice from our office.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Please call (651) 641-1011 to verify times for this week\'s phone intake.
